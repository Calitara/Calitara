👋 Hi, I’m @Calitara but Tara is fine.

👀 I’m interested in learning how to code in every language. I'd rather be good/an expert (if possible) at coding in every language than
only one language.

🌱 I’m currently learning python and java. However, I'd still like to learn more.

💞️ Things I'm working on:
- learning how to use this website more often lol
- doing some configuring
- finding ways to make any system more efficient
